# RegressionAnalysis

The python file Part1_A.ipynb consist of the python scripts written to analyse the dataset (CSV file - coursework1.csv). 

The analysis was as follows:

  *Identify the problem whether the dataset is a Supervised (Regression/Classification) problem or an Un-Supervised (Clustering) problem. 
  
  *Since the problem was a REGRESSION problem, three algorithms were implemented:
  
   *Linear Regression 
   *Rigde Regression
   *Lasso Regression
   
  *To optimise the hyperparameters and find the best set of parameters, an Optimisation algorithm GridSearchCV was used. 
  
  *To compare the performance of models, a Regression baseline model was also implemented. 
  
  *To analyse the performance of all the models, three regression metrics were used for discrete data:
  
   *Mean Squared Error
   *Mean Absolute Error
   *R2 Score
   
Note: The work was done by me as a part of the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence module assessment in degree MSc Data Science at the University of Bristol, UK.
